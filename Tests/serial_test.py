Serial_test.py

Sends commands to Arduino Uno via serial port to control a drone
using the nRF24L01 wireless boards.

The arrow keys control elevator and aileron (forward/reverse and left/right)
and the w,s keys control throttle, and the a,d, keys control the rudder (yaw)

This uses the msvcrt library, so it only works under Windows.
